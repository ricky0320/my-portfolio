## User Story:
As a full time IT employee, I want to expand my knowledge and get to know about coding. I've joint the part time UC Berkeley Coding BootCamp and it is helping me build my knowledge and skills I needed for the industry and eventually a career change. Besides JavaScript and some other programming language, I've learnt a lot of important stuff like Github and NodeJs etc, joinning the relative communities, communicating with group members and splitting the duties between different roles.
